# Python in an hour

This repo will give you a very brief introduction to what Python can do for you as someone who works with data, and some of the advantages of using Python over tools like Excel.

It's designed to be run in Google Colab: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/nhsengland/python-in-an-hour/blob/main/rap_example_pipeline_python.ipynb">

</a>

there is also a second notebook, which shows how to use `dtale` to explore data

## Description

### What we'll do

This code demonstrates - in a very simple way - the three main steps common to almost all analytical processes:

1. Get the data - in this case we'll download the artificial HES data from the web
2. Process the data - we'll do a simple aggregation
3. Making outputs - we'll make some charts

### The data we'll use

We'll use the artificial Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. This has the same structure as the real HES used in our industry, but it's mock data - there's no personally identifiable information in it. 

### Packages

One of the great advantages of Python is that you can use other people's code in your projects. This can save you a lot of time!

How this works is like this:

1. Someone writes some useful Python code
2. They think, "Hey this would be really useful, I want to share this with the world!"
3. They turn their code into something called a "package"
4. They upload their package to a central package repository called PyPi
5. You install their package from PyPi and use their code in your project!

### Pandas

In this demo, we'll use a package called `Pandas`.

Pandas can do pretty much anything you can do with other tools like Excel and SQL. You can filter, group, create aggregations, make pivot tables, and, in combination with other packages, even make charts!

It's one of the most commonly-used packages by data analysts.


## Prerequisites

This code requires:

- Python (> 3.6), the official Python website has [instructions for downloading and installing python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

## Getting Started

### Running locally

1. Clone the repository. To learn about what this means, and how to use Git, see the [Git guide](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/using-git-collaboratively/).

```
git clone https://github.com/nhsengland/python_colab_tutorial.git
```

2. Set up your environment.

#### Using pip

If you're using Windows, enter the following commands into the Command Line or Powershell:

```
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're using Linux or MacOS, enter the following commands into the Terminal:

```
python -m venv .venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Visual Studio Code it is necessary that you change your default interpreter to the virtual environment you just created .venv. To do this use the shortcut Ctrl-Shift-P, search for Python: Select interpreter and select .venv from the list.

For more information on how to use virtual environments and why they are important, see the [virtual environments guide](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/python/virtual-environments/why-use-virtual-environments/).

### Running in Codespace/Google Colab

You can also load the repo into a GitHub Codespace (click the blue "Code" button and then click "Create Codespace"), or in Google Colab (see the links at the top of the page)
